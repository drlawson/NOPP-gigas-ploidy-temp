# NOPP-cgigas-ploidy-temp

Project funded by the [NOPP](https://www.nopp.org/)

Experiment design:
1. Effect of seawater-temp:ploidy interaction on physiology, gene expression, and mortality
2. Experiment to be done at Pt. Whitney Shellfish Hatchery
3. 90 diploid (3-5cm), 90 triploid (2-4cm) juvenile cgigas
4. Slow temperature ramp to 30C from 10C (2C day-1), 10 days total
5. Feed (mixed algal diet) at 250,000 cell/ml, consistently
6. x2 tanks - 1 ambient, 1 elevated temp
7. Four timepoints: t-10 (10C), t+2(30C, 2d), t+14 (30C, 2w), t+30 (30C,4w)
8.
